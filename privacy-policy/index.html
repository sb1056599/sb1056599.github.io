                <p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Effective date: 23rd of September 2016</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">We at Mr. Reply know you care about how your personal information is used and shared, and we take your privacy seriously. Please read the following to learn more about our Privacy Policy.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>By using or accessing the Services in any manner, you acknowledge that you accept the practices and policies outlined in this Privacy Policy, and you hereby consent that we will collect, use, and share your information in the following ways.</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Remember that your use of Mr. Reply’s Services is at all times subject to the <a href="http://wordpress-28786-66198-190032.cloudwaysapps.com/terms-of-use/"><u>Terms of Use</u></a>, which incorporates this Privacy Policy. Any terms we use in this Policy without defining them have the definitions given to them in the <a href="http://wordpress-28786-66198-190032.cloudwaysapps.com/terms-of-use/"><u>Terms of Use</u></a>.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>What does this Privacy Policy cover</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">This Privacy Policy covers our treatment of personally identifiable information (&#8220;Personal Information&#8221;) that we gather when you are accessing or using our Services, but not to the practices of companies we don’t own or control, or people that we don’t manage. We gather various types of Personal Information from our users, as explained in more detail below, and we use this Personal Information internally in connection with our Services, including to personalize, provide, and improve our services, to allow you to set up a user account, to enable you to build chatbots and communicate with chatbots others have built, to contact you and allow other users to contact you, to fulfill your requests for certain products and services, and to analyze how you use the Services. In certain cases, we may also share some Personal Information with third parties, but only as described below.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">As noted in the <a href="http://wordpress-28786-66198-190032.cloudwaysapps.com/terms-of-use/"><u>Terms of Use</u></a>, we do not knowingly collect or solicit personal information from anyone under the age of 13. If you are under 13, please do not attempt to register for the Services or send any personal information about yourself to us. If we learn that we have collected personal information from a child under age 13, we will delete that information as quickly as possible. If you believe that a child under 13 may have provided us personal information, please contact us at info.mrreply@gmail.com.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>Will Mr. Reply ever change this Privacy Policy</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">We’re constantly trying to improve our Services, so we may need to change this Privacy Policy from time to time as well, but we will alert you to changes by placing a notice on Mr. Reply.com, by sending you an email, and/or by some other means. Please note that if you’ve opted not to receive legal notice emails from us (or you haven’t provided us with your email address), those legal notices will still govern your use of the Services, and you are still responsible for reading and understanding them. If you use the Services after any changes to the Privacy Policy have been posted, that means you agree to all of the changes. Use of information we collect now is subject to the Privacy Policy in effect at the time such information is used.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>What Information does Mr. Reply Collect</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><u>Information You Provide to Us:</u></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">We receive and store any information you knowingly provide to us. For example, if you create an account on our Services to build a chatbot, through the registration process and/or through</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">your account settings, we may collect Personal Information such as, but not limited to, your name, email address, timezone, list of Facebook Pages you own. Or, if you are an individual who communicates with chatbots that have been created using our services, we may collect information such as, but not limited to, your name, gender, time zone, and avatar/picture. If you provide your Facebook or other third-party account credentials to, you understand some content and/or information in those accounts (“Third Party Account Information”) may be transmitted into your account with us, and that Third Party Account Information transmitted to our Services is covered by this Privacy Policy; for example, when you log in to our Services using your Facebook Messenger account, we may receive your personal information associated with that account, such as your Facebook pages. Certain information may be required to register with us or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><u>Information Collected Automatically</u></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Whenever you interact with our Services, we automatically receive and record information on our server logs from your browser or device, which may include any chatbots you have created using the Services, your conversation history with the chatbots(s), IP address, geolocation data, device identification, “cookie” information, the type of browser and/or device you’re using to access our Services, and the page or feature you requested. “Cookies” are identifiers we transfer to your browser or device that allow us to recognize your browser or device and tell us how and when pages and features in our Services are visited and by how many people. You may be able to change the preferences on your browser or device to prevent or limit your device’s acceptance of cookies, but this may prevent you from taking advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">If you click on a link to a third party website or service, a third party may also transmit cookies to you. Again, this Privacy Policy does not cover the use of cookies by any third parties, and we aren’t responsible for their privacy policies and practices. Please be aware that cookies placed by third parties may continue to track your activities online even after you have left our Services, and those third parties may not honor “Do Not Track” requests you have set using your browser or device.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">We may use this data to customize content for you that we think you might like, based on your usage patterns. We may also use it to improve the Services or to help developers build better chatbots– for example, this data can tell us how often users use a particular feature of the Services, or what kinds of questions users ask of certain chatbots, and we can use that knowledge to make the Services and the chatbots created through the Services interesting to as many users as possible.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><em><u>Information Collected From Other Websites and Do Not Track Policy</u></em></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">Through cookies we place on your browser or device, we may collect information about your online activity after you leave our Services. Just like any other usage information we collect, this information allows us to improve the Services and customize your online experience, and otherwise as described in this Privacy Policy. Your browser may offer you a “Do Not Track” option, which allows you to signal to operators of websites and web applications and services (including behavioral advertising services) that you do not wish such operators to track certain of your online activities over time and across different websites. Our Services do not support Do Not Track requests at this time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>Will Mr. Reply Share Any of the Personal Information it Receives</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><br />
</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">We do not rent or sell your Personal Information in personally identifiable form to anyone. We may share your Personal Information with third parties as described in this section:</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Information that’s been de-identified. </strong>We may de-identify your Personal Information so that you are not identified as an individual, and provide that information to our partners. We may also provide aggregate usage information to our partners (or allow partners to collect that information from you), who may use such information to understand how often and in what ways people use our Services, so that they, too, can provide you with an optimal online experience. However, we never disclose aggregate usage or de-identified information to a partner (or allow a partner to collect such information) in a manner that would identify you as an individual person.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Chatbot Developers: </strong>The developers/owners of chatbots created through the Services which you communicate with will have access to the Personal Information you provide to them. For example, if you communicate with a chatbot which was created through the Services, the developer/owner of that chatbot may have access to your conversation history with the chatbot, your username, your avatar, and any other information you provide through the chatbot. In addition, the chatbot developer/owner may use a Salesforce or other third party product integration to receive and process the data from your interaction with the chatbot.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Affiliated Businesses: </strong>In certain situations, businesses or third party websites we’re affiliated with may sell or provide products or services to you through or in connection with the Services (either alone or jointly with us). You can recognize when an affiliated business is associated with such a transaction or service, and we will share your Personal Information with that affiliated business only to the extent that it is related to such transaction or service. One such service may include the ability for you to automatically transmit Third Party Account Information, such as your Facebook Messenger profile information, to your Services profile or to automatically transmit information in your Services profile to your third party account. We have no control over the policies and practices of third party websites or businesses as to privacy or anything else, so if you choose to take part in any transaction or service relating to an affiliated website or business, please review all such business’ or websites’ policies.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Agents: </strong>We employ other companies and people to perform tasks on our behalf and need to share your information with them to provide products or services to you; for example, we may use a payment processing company to receive and process your credit card transactions for us. Unless we tell you differently, our agents do not have any right to use the Personal Information we share with them beyond what is necessary to assist us. Note that an “agent” may also be considered a “partner” in certain circumstances, and would be subject to the terms of the “<strong>Information that’s</strong> <strong>been de-identified</strong>” section in that regard.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Business Transfers: </strong>We may choose to buy or sell assets, and may share and/or transfer customer information in connection with the evaluation of and entry into such transactions. Also, if we (or our assets) are acquired, or if we go out of business, enter bankruptcy, or go through some other change of control, Personal Information could be one of the assets transferred to or acquired by a third party.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Protection of Mr. Reply and Others: </strong>We reserve the right to access, read, preserve, and disclose any information that we believe is necessary to comply with law or court order; enforce or apply our <u>Terms of Use</u> and other agreements; or protect the rights, property, or safety of Mr. Reply, our employees, our users, or others.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>Is Personal Information about me secure</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong> </strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Your account is protected by a password for your privacy and security. If you access your account via Facebook or another third party site or service, you may have additional or different sign-on protections via that third party site or service. You must prevent unauthorized access to your account and Personal Information by selecting and protecting your password and/or other sign-on mechanism appropriately and limiting access to your computer or device and browser by signing off after you have finished accessing your account.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">We endeavor to protect the privacy of your account and other Personal Information we hold in our records, but unfortunately, we cannot guarantee complete security. Unauthorized entry or use, hardware or software failure, and other factors, may compromise the security of user information at any time.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>What choices do I have</u></strong><strong>?</strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">You can always opt not to disclose information to us, but keep in mind some information may be needed to register with us, to communicate with chatbots, or to take advantage of some of our features.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">You may stop using the Services at any time; however, your conversation logs from communications with chatbots may remain in our records.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;"><strong><u>What if I have questions about this policy?</u></strong></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">
<p style="text-align: left;">If you have any questions or concerns regarding our privacy policies, please send us a detailed message to info.mrreply@gmail.com, and we will try to resolve your concerns.</p>
